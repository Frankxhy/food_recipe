## CookAI: Cooking Recipe Generation using Deep Learning Models

*Installation:*

We use Google Colab to run this code. This code uses python language to train model and plot the graphs.

Please install python 3.7 or later, install pytorch 0.4 or later.

*Training:*

Use the src/train.py to train the model, we train the model with different learning rate and number of iterations.

*Experiment:*

Use the src/CookingDemo.ipnb to get the model results. We input the food image in data/my_food folder, and the model will generate the Title of this input image, and instructions.
