## CookAI: Cooking Recipe Generation using Deep Learning Models

**Installation:**

We use Google Colab to run this code. This code uses python language to train model and plot the graphs.

Please install python 3.7 or later, install pytorch 0.4 or later.



**Experiment:**

Use the src/CookingDemo.ipnb to get the model results. We input the food image in data/my_food folder, and the model will generate the Title of this input image, and instructions.

We use src/plot.py to create plots. These plots analyzes the performance of model under different number of blocks and multi-heads.
